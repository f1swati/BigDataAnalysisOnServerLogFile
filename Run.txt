Steps to run the program:

1.	(Optional) - to run the fileGeneration.java

	The Program generates the input test file for testing Most frequent Site visitor program.
	The objective of the program is to generate a simulated server log file of visitors

 	Variables: Change the following variables in code for required test file	
 	int numberOfRecords = 50000000;
 	String lowerDatelimit = "2010-01-01 00:00:00";
 	String upperDatelimit = "2016-02-20 00:00:00";
 
	 Then run the module fileGeneration.java
 
2.	ServerLogFileAnalysisMain.java
 	The Program analyses the server log file of API calls and provides the list
 	of the top 5 IP addresses (users) which have the maximum API calls for the log.
 	
 	- When you have the input file ready, place the file in the testCases path.
 	- Make sure you name the file as "TestCase.txt"
 	- The program by default will pick the file from testCases path
 	- You can also change the file name and path by changing it in the program
 	- Run module ServerLogFileAnalysisMain.java
